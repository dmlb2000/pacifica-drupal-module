      title: Saccharomyces Genome Database
      body: |
        The SGD provides Internet access to the complete Saccharomyces
        cerevisiae genomic DNA sequence, its genes and their products, the
        phenotypes of its mutants, and the literature supporting these data. In
        the peer-reviewed literature report, experiment result on function and
        interaction of yeast genes are extracted by high-quality manual
        curation and integrated within a well-developed database. The data are
        combined with quality high-throughput results and post on Locus Summary
        pages which is a powerful query engine and rich genome browser. Based
        on the complexity of information collection, multiple bioinformatic
        tools are used to integrate information and allow productive discovery
        of new biological details.[2] The gold standard for functional
        description of budding yeast is provided by SGD resource. The SGD
        resource also provide a platform from which to investigate related
        genes and pathways in higher organisms. The amount of information and
        the number of features provided by SGD have increased greatly following
        the release of the S. cerevisiae genomic sequence. SGD aids researchers
        by providing not only basic information, but also tools such as
        sequence similarity searching that lead to detailed information about
        features of the genome and relationships between genes. SGD presents
        information using a variety of user-friendly, dynamically created
        graphical displays illustrating physical, genetic and sequence feature
        maps. All of the data in SGD are freely accessible to researchers and
        educators worldwide via web pages designed for optimal ease of use.

      title: External Web Firewall Data
      body: |
        Cisco ASA firewalls protect our external web space and recieve a lot of
        traffic. This traffic has been anonymised, cleaned and made available
        to the public for research purposes.

      title: Simulated Climate Model (Regional Southeast US)
      body: |
        This model data was focused on the regional data southeast United
        States, extending east to west Africa coast. The training time is from
        1990-2010 and is simulated through 2070-2100.
