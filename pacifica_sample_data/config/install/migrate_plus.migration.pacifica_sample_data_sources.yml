      title: NextSeq 2000
      body: |
        NextSeq 2000 is redesigned from the ground up to maximize future
        proofing, offering sequencing power for high throughput applications.
        Offering scalability for evolving needs and larger studies, it
        supports a vast variety of applications, including:

        Single-Cell Gene Expression
        (100 cycles) 4k cells; 10k reads/cell
          
        Examine the transcriptomes of individual cells for a high-resolution
        view of cell-to-cell variation. Explore the distinct biology of
        individual cells in complex tissues and understand cellular
        subpopulation responses to environmental cues. With P2 reagents,
        analyze 10 samples in approximately 13 hours. Or step up to P3 reagents
        to analyze 25 samples in approximately 19 hours.

        Whole-Exome Sequencing
        (200 cycles) 50× mean target coverage

        Exome sequencing is a cost-effective approach when whole-genome
        sequencing is not practical or necessary. Efficiently identify coding
        variants across a broad range of applications, including population
        genetics, genetic disease, and cancer studies. In about 21 hours you
        can analyze 16 samples with P2 reagents – with P3, get 40 whole exomes
        in about 33 hours.

        Shotgun Metagenomics
        (300 cycles) 50M reads/sample

        Comprehensively sample all genes in all organisms present in a given
        complex sample. Evaluate bacterial diversity and detect the abundance
        of microbes in various environments or study unculturable
        microorganisms that are otherwise difficult or impossible to analyze.
        In approximately 29 hours you can have data from 8 samples using P2
        reagents. Scale up to 20 samples in approximately 48 hours with P3
        reagents.
